# Wordle-In-Python
This GitHub repository contains a Python implementation of the popular word-guessing game, Wordle. Wordle is a word puzzle game where players are given six chances to guess a hidden five-letter word. This repository provides a fun and interactive way to learn and play Wordle in a Python environment.


## Features:
1. Interactive Wordle Gameplay: Experience the excitement of playing Wordle in a Python console.
2. Randomly Generated Word: A five-letter word is randomly selected from a wordlist, and your objective is to guess it within six attempts.
3. User Input Handling: The program accepts your guesses and provides feedback on the correctness of your guess.
4. Feedback Mechanism: After each guess, the program provides valuable feedback, indicating which letters are correctly placed (in green), which letters are part of the word but in the wrong position (in yellow), and which letters are not in the word (in gray).
5. Game Progression: Keep track of your progress with each guess, counting down your remaining attempts and displaying your previous guesses.

Have fun playing Wordle and honing your word-guessing skills with this Python implementation!
